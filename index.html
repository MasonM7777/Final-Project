                    <h2>Technical Skills & Programming</h2>
                    <p> I'm passionate about programming and continuously improving my skills. 
                        As a current computer programming student, I have experience with multiple 
                        programming languages and frameworks, including C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
                        Bootstrap. My main focus has been web development, where I've built responsive
                        websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrating frameworks like Bootstrap
                        for optimal layouts.

                        I have hands-on experience in creating applications with a strong understanding 
                        of object-oriented programming principles, which has helped me develop clean and 
                        efficient code. I'm particularly excited about leveraging my programming knowledge 
                        to build functional, user-friendly applications and contribute to innovative projects.</p>

            <!-- Column 2 -->
            <div class="col-12 col-md-4">
                <div class="content-box">
                    <h2>Project Portfolio & Achievements</h2>
                    <p>I've had the privilege to work on several meaningful projects throughout 
                        my studies, where I've not only developed my technical skills but also 
                        learned to manage time, overcome challenges, and work towards delivering 
                        results. One notable project I'm currently working on is a budget management 
                        tool, which tracks income and expenses on a weekly basis, helping users improve 
                        their budgeting skills and project their yearly cash flow.
                        Another highlight includes creating interactive 3D scenes using A-Frame, 
                        where I learned how to integrate objects into a virtual space and reskin them. 
                        This hands-on experience has given me a deeper understanding of immersive technology
                         and its applications.</p>

                    <h2>Professional Mindset & Future Goals</h2>
                    <p>I'm a reliable, quick learner with a mindset focused on continuous improvement and 
                        problem-solving. I pride myself on being resilient, adaptable, and meticulous in 
                        my approach to programming. I believe in the importance of thoughtful design and 
                        user-friendly interfaces, and my goal is to always create code that's not only 
                        functional but also intuitive and maintainable.

                        Looking forward, I'm eager to apply my skills in a real-world setting, collaborating 
                        with others to create innovative software solutions. I'm particularly interested in 
                        working on projects that have a meaningful impact, whether that's improving user 
                        experiences or streamlining complex processes with code.</p>

                    <h2>Project: Exam 1</h2>
                    <p>In this project, I learned the absolute basics of web development. I began by 
                        understanding the structure of an HTML document, including how to declare the 
                        language of the website with html lang="en" to ensure proper accessibility and 
                        localization. I also explored the fundamental components of a webpage. Additionally, I learned how t
                        o set the background color of a page using CSS, giving the website its 
                        first layer of design. This project provided a solid foundation for building and structuring simple web pages.</p>

                    <h2>Project: AFrame</h2>
                    <p>In this project, I learned how to work with A-Frame, a web framework for building virtual 
                        reality experiences. As a beginner, I focused on placing 3D objects into the scene, such 
                        as cubes, spheres, and other geometric shapes. I also experimented with reskinning these 
                        objects by changing their textures and colors, allowing me to create different visual styles. 
                        The main challenge was understanding the basic structure of an A-Frame scene, but through 
                        practice, I became more comfortable manipulating the objects and adjusting their properties. 
                        This project helped me gain a foundation in 3D web development.</p>

                    <h2>Project: Building a Website</h2>
                    <p>In this project, I applied everything I had learned about web development over a set period of time. 
                        I focused on using CSS to enhance the visual appeal of the website by adding shadows to text and 
                        colors, giving the page a more dynamic and polished look. Additionally, I learned how to embed links 
                        directly into text, allowing for easy navigation between pages and external resources. This project 
                        helped solidify my understanding of how to bring together design elements and 
                        functionality to create a cohesive, user-friendly website.</p>
